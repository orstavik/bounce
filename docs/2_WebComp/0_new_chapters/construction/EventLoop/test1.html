<!--
todo the bug. the event-loop cannot start until it gets the readystatechange event. So this listener needs to be the native one.
 The monkey patches use the native event listener and dispatch event.
 As the later monkeyPatches change them, this becomes a problem. So.
 The monkeypatch for the EventLoop needs the native event listener? Yeah. If not, it depends on itself before it starts itself.
 ..
 How should we make that MonkeyPatch system? Should we provide methods for it? yes, some simple ones.
 And, we also need to get the OG from some of them. This we could probably do on the function itself.
 Just attach setTimeout.OG = native.setTimeout. Yeah. Such a system is easier to read.
 And then we need the monkeyPatch function for everything, because it gives us the meta view list of which monkeypatches are
 done.
